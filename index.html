							<h2>Software Engineer</h2>
							<p>
								I am a passionate gamer who also enjoys solving problems using code.
								Most of my time post university was spent self-teaching new programming skills and building video games while solo developing an inventory management app for a local buisness.
								Here is a collection of my largest software engineering projects from my time in school alongside various video games that I have developed while learning Unreal Engine 4.

							<h2>Software Engineering Projects</h2>
							<hr />
							<p>
								The following are a few major projects that I worked on while I attended The University of North Texas. 
								They feature a wide range of programming skills using multiple different languages and methods to exceed project expectations.

									<h3>C++ Library Book Service and  Database - Solo Project</h3>
									<p>
										A C++ program that allows users to create library accounts and check out library
										books with the accommodating services and systems, including: book searching, user data storage, catalog editing,
										and late fees.
										<br><br>
										<u>Utilizes:</u> C/C++
										<br><br>
										This program features:
										<ul>
											<li>A novice understanding of Object Oriented Design and Programming</li>
											<li>Usage of C++'s FILE I/O systems and functions to store all Library information locally</li>
											<li>Self taught usage of C++'s vector data structure throughout the entire project</li>
											<li>And a very basic User Interface</li>
										</ul>
										The biggest takeaway from this project was learning the importance of organization between both design and code in order to keep track of each feature and how they all connect.

									<h3>Live Resatuarant Service Web Application - Team Project</h3>
									<p>
										A web based application that allows a restaurant to give its staff and
										customers a digital gateway to communicate the daily menu and order requests without
										the need for a physically present waiter at all times.
									</p>
									<p>
										<u>Utilizes:</u> HTML5, PHP, SQL, CSS, and JavaScript
									</p>
									<p>
										For this project, I was responsible for managing and organizing a proper development schedule for our team to build a successful product.
										<br>The main features that I developed:
										<ul>
											<li>Both the front-end and back-end of the login screen for each type of app user <code>(Customer, Kitchen Staff, and Waiter Staff)</code></li>
											<li>Menu design and functionaly for both the customer side and the staff/kitchen side of the application</li>
											<li>Most of the PHP instruction and implementation where the HTML code connects to the online database</li>
											<li>I also lead the transformation of most of our HTML code to be embedded into PHP to consolidate our files and build the final product efficiently</li>
										</ul>
										Unfortunately, the server that we used to host the web application has been shut down, but we are still able to provide all of the code, stock photos, and other miscellaneous files involved.
										<br>Of course, start with the "index" file if you want to keep track of where you are.

									<h3>Marching Band Database Android Application</h3>
									<p>
										An Android application that allows marching band programs to store, organize, and edit all of their paper based music and drill locally or within an
										online database server. 
										<br><br>
										<u>Utilizes:</u> Java, Android, PHP, and SQLite
										<br><br>
										In this project, I managed communicatively challenged team members to meet and complete major project objectives however possible.
										My major other contributions to the project include:
										<ul>
											<li>Having a background in music and marching band allowed me to lead the team's project design and organization throughout development</li>
											<li>I conducted the communication of new ideas, major design issues, and changes with the client</li>
											<li>Learning and teaching the team how to use SQLite within our Java project code</li>
											<li>Building the PHP code required to connect our app to the online database</li>
										</ul>
										<br>
										The most effective lesson learned from this project was learning how to redesign and/or cut initial features from the final product in order to meet the deadline while overcoming our communication challenges.

										<h2>Unreal 4 Video Game Projects</h2>
										<hr />
										<p>
											Here are some of my most developed games that I have been building upon with each iteration.
											I started out focusing on learning how to read and program with Unreal Engine 4's Blueprints before combining my C++ skills to build more in-depth and adaptive features.
											Unfortunately, the stock, starter, and other free visual resources leave much to be desired visually, but I am still able to showcase my accomplishments through each game's core mechanics instead.
											<br>
											The following games have also, most importantly, been heavily inspired by Star Wars.

										<h2>Starfighter Video Game</h2>
										<p>
											This first game, was made with classic Star Wars starfighter combat in mind.
											Mostly done with Blueprints, I learned how to build a Player Character Starfighter from scratch with full action controls, firing projectiles, and taking/dealing damage.
											The most advanced tech featured was the transposition of butterfly AI movement from a UE4 learning project to fit an AI starfighter that flies around in random circular motion until they detect the player.
											This game was finished with a simple beginning and end match formula.
											<br><br>
											Important Note: All Star Wars assets used within this project do not belong to me. This project was built for educational purposes only.

										<h2>3rd Person RPG Features</h2>
										<p>
											The development of this game was done fully in UE4's Blueprints mostly to explore more in-depth Blueprint fundamentals.
											The major Blueprint features that I delved into were: Basic AI Behaviour Trees, Blueprint Interfaces, Animation Blueprints, and interactive UI features.
											This was also the first project that I started to implement UE4's client-server networking code within Blueprints, mostly replicating movement, andimations, and object variables.
											<br><br>
											Unfortunately, this game was left unfinished to reiterate on each feature more efficiently and to explore more advanced ideas.

										<h2>Online Multiplayer Shooter with Objectives</h2>
										<p>
											This game was an attempt to reenvision the old Star Wars: Bounty Hunter game with a sort of Battle Royale twist on it.
											I focused on building base game mechanics first in C++ including player controls, action abilities, and interactable environment and objectives.
											Then I supplemented each mechanic with features that were more intuitive to be implemented in Blueprint such as advanced AI Behavior Trees, level blueprint events, and dynamic UI displays.
											My network programming skills in UE4 were also expanded upon with learning how to utilize the client-server model in C++.
											<br><br>
											Technically this game is still unfinished in terms of scope, but it does have a starting line and a Victory/Defeat screen to signal the ends of a match.

											<h2>Online Co-operative Action-Adventure</h2>
											<p>
												This is my most recently built game that is still in development. I wanted to make a co-operative squad shooter where each member of the team has a unique set of skills and equipment that compliment the team environment.
												Development for this game was also intuitively split between C++ and Blueprint with the design focus on building the game around the four unique character classes.
												<br><br>
												The main advancements made in this game comparatively are the increased amount of dynamic player abilities and equipment, more efficient network code, larger emphasis on multiplayer design and gameplay, and an expanded use of UE4's components.
												The Steam API was also heavily utilized in connecting multiple players online and displaying their Steam information in the UI.
												My most proudest achievement so far has been the development of the AI drone companion within the network and without the use of UE4's traditional Behaviour Tree functions. This companion not only follows and defends the player around the world, but also acts as a mobile combat healer.
												<br><br>
												This project is the consolidation of all my work throughout my previous games into one with more fleshed out mechanics but within a smaller scaled scope.
